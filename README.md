# DMWC-HunterMod
-Mod with additional functions (base frome Biggie)

-Ground funktions and shots are working 

-Tranqshot is in testing, with 2 types of frenzy recognition one by reading CHAT_MSG_ADDON and one by SPELL_AURA_APPLIED (If Tranqshot Mana is checked it will hold back hardcoded 15% Mana to Tranqshot)

-I found no solution for Improved Hunters Mark, Cause Imp cant override the normal one. (just dont skill it)

-Maybe I also need to change some values.
